# Experiment verification

From the repository root, provision dependencies with
`bun install --frozen-lockfile --cwd experiments/proa-server` and run:

```
bun experiments/proa-server/tools/verify.ts
bun experiments/proa-server/tools/capture.ts
bun test experiments/proa-server/tools
```

Prerequisites are the experiment README's pinned Rust 1.99.1 and Proa 0.1.3,
Bun, Linux flock, and local Chromium (`CHROMIUM_BIN`, default /usr/bin/chromium).
Capture uses offline dependency resolution; provision Cargo dependencies with the
Rust gate first. The full Rust gate also needs an installed local PostgreSQL
cluster (on Debian: provision with the repository's `scripts/postgres-live.sh install`
as a maintainer). With `AB_POSTGRES_TEST_URL` unset, the gate invokes
`scripts/postgres-live.sh ensure-running` and explicitly uses
`postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres`. A nonblank override must name a
loopback administrative connection; it bypasses the helper, and invalid connections
fail without fallback. The gate never installs, stops or resets PostgreSQL.

The locked private `s3rver` 3.7.1 dependency supplies a real local HTTP S3 subset,
binding loopback port zero in a unique temporary directory. Startup probes signed
upload/download through the actual TypeScript AWS client. Production blob settings
are removed, and exact test endpoint/credentials are passed explicitly to both clients.
The TypeScript producer creates a uniquely named database/SELECT-only role, writes
all three event and artifact scopes through the actual store, and invokes the native
Rust reader. Cleanup closes clients and removes only that run's database, role,
server and directory, including failure paths. Startup/teardown are bounded.
No forge or live sandbox runner is needed. Capture alone remains offline and does
not provision either service.
The proa-rust gate runs `bun test tools` from the experiment directory before
Rust checks, so negative capture fixtures, route coverage and pipeline regressions
are enforced for every applicable build. Capture-build mode only exports the
server; it does not recursively run the tooling tests.
The real server serves the worktree's local assets. Do not run against a .env
containing production settings.

Cargo targets, including Proa linked descriptor/final compilation, share a cache
below XDG_CACHE_HOME (default ~/.cache), keyed by canonical Git common directory,
experiment, Rust and Proa versions. PROA_VERIFY_CACHE may explicitly override it
with an absolute path outside every worktree. flock serializes the entire gate;
the OS releases the lock on process exit, including crashes. Each build exports
its own executable under ignored root .ab/proa-build-* before releasing the lock.
Never capture a mutable executable directly from the shared cache.

Accepted cache limitation: pinned Proa 0.1.3 hashes the absolute package path
into its linked descriptor/final namespaces. Ordinary Cargo artifacts reuse
across worktrees; linked dependencies currently rebuild in a new worktree.
Same-worktree reuse works. See FIELD-NOTES.md for the two-worktree measurements;
operator guidance accepts this partial reuse for the cross-build cache criterion.
Revisit linked reuse when upgrading Proa; keep linked builds and the pinned
toolchain enabled.

Capture evidence is under the printed .ab/proa-frames-* directory, including
inventory.json, verify-report.md and eight PNGs. Each run owns a server port,
Chromium profile and exported executable. Process cleanup runs in finally and
termination handlers. Old evidence/build logs can be deleted when no longer needed.
The agent must inspect every PNG; deterministic probes are necessary, not a
substitute for visual judgment. Route declarations are classified independently
of cases in capture-cases.ts; new/unsupported declarations fail closed. Extend
cases with every HTML route/state, 1440/390 widths and light/dark grounds. Supply
explicit seeded identifiers for parameterized routes, never guessed ids.

Data contract: the native configured reader and the deliberately unconfigured shell
are distinct modes. Proa's generated database layer remains `database.driver=none`;
the native reader is initialized separately before binding. Current pages read no
data, so capture starts in an isolated cwd with no inherited database/blob credentials
and renders the unchanged shell. Source inventory rejects page-level data/auth reads
until a seeded capture contract is supplied. The full gate's data proof is separate
from pixel capture and never invents browser records.

Corpus generation: `bun tools/generate-fixtures.ts` from the experiment executes
scenario/compatibility producers, captures per-store logs and validates every event
catalog witness. Verification runs `bun tools/check-fixtures.ts` before Cargo tests;
it recomputes TypeScript answers and checks source hashes without regenerating goldens.
`tests/reducer_parity.rs` compares native replay and chunked advancement field by field.
`tools/data-integration.ts` proves TS-write/Rust-read PostgreSQL/blob interoperability,
read-only tables, incremental suffix counts, restart and failure isolation.

Auth contract: **auth=none** today. When authentication arrives, signed-in capture
must use a local development session issued by Rust. Require development-mode
switch plus loopback binding plus loopback peer validation; refuse production and
non-loopback issuance. Ordinary operation disables or omits the issuer. Add
refusal tests and signed-in route cases with that change. Browser cookie stubs and
GitHub authentication are forbidden. Current capture claims no signed-in coverage.
